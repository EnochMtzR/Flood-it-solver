# Flood-it solver

This is a quick solution (2h) to the famous single person game _flood-it_. I'm using a very simple **greedy algorithm** for the solution

## Improvements

For time constraining reasons, I wasn't able to implement all features I wanted like a _strategy solver_ for handling more than 1 solving algorithm.

Also I would have love to include an **A\* Algorithm** solution to the problem. perhaps in a future visit ;).

I'm not quite happy yet how the `Solver` class ended up. This is for sure a _"must to do later"_.
